					Demons, thieves, sphinxes, skeletons and shapeshifters open the way to victory on this deck that aims to control the table and keep it clean. These creatures come and go from the graveyard with mastery, yet they cost a lot, and until it is possible for them to come into play safely, nothing should remain on the battlefield. For this purpose, many removals and counter-matches must prevent the opponent from use their main weapons.

					The deck is divided into parts, and all of them must act together for their perfect operation. First let's talk about the lands, which has the important function of allowing the use of couterspells without crack the player's turn, so it is important to have a high mana base, and for that i use 23 lands with 5 blue and black, the others divided proportionately between colors, except for one that is colorless and can be used to protect creatures that is the Endless Sands. This distribution allows you not to miss land for cast and counter when we use extra draw.

					The second part consists of draw cards, not allowing the opponent's main weapons to go unanswered. The main draw cards are Glimmer of Genius and Eternal of Harsh Truths, the first uses energy mechanics, giving 2 energy, scry 2 and two draws, allowing the player to choose what they need most at that moment in the game. The second is a 1/3 creature that draws a card when it is not blocked, as it has grieve 2, it is up to the opponent to choose to take 2 damage, or 1 and give the draw to the controlling player. In addition the Glimmer of Genius has a great synergy with other parts of the deck that will be seen ahead. It also has the Countervailing Winds that with the mechanics of cycling allows the rotation of cards in the library, or its use as counterspell.

					In the third part is where all the cards control, removals and counterspells are. Currently the deck has many more removals than counters, and the black color is ideal for this, but depending on the opponent it is better to reverse the game and use counterspells. The main removals are Walk the Plank and Essence Extraction, the first to be able to remove any creature, regardless of its size, minus merfolk, and the second for theft based on the damage done. Vanquish the Weak (2B) also has its important due to the cost of mana differentiated from the Essence Extraction (1BB), this difference in colors allows greater freedom in its use. The Trial of Ambition (1B) also plays its role in fighting the Cartouche of Ambition (2B). However, by exception of Walk the Plank, they are removals only for small creatures, in the case of decks that use large creatures, it is better to prevent their entry using counterspells. The counterspells cause the creature or other spells to be eliminated before entering the battlefield, here present in  blue color. The reason removals are better in other situations is that they can be played at any time, other than counterspells, which can only be played in response to something. The main cards are Scatter Essence, Negate, and Cancel.

					All mechanics and card categories mentioned above are part of the overall control of the table, not allowing the opponent to bring the best weapons to the game. Because it is a deck with only 10 creatures (including repeated ones), it is very important that the control be well established. Some creatures and artifacts have the function of generating energy, this mechanic allows abilities to have a cost different from the traditional mana, the amount of energy of a player only decreases when he uses it, which makes it an excellent mechanic for control decks. The cards that have function of generating energy are Glint-sleeve Siphoner (1B),  Dynavolt Tower (3) and Demon of Dark Schemes (3BBB). The last two are excellent win conditions, the demon allows a creature from the graveyard to return to the battlefield, in addition to being a 5/5 that flies, from -2/-2 to all creatures in the field when entering, and the player gains energy whenever another creature dies, and the Dynavolt Tower generates energy when instant or sorcerys are casted giving great support either to destroy other creatures or to deal damage to the opponent by using or feeding the Demon of Dark Schemes, these cards must safely enter the field. As Wildcard the deck has two copies of the Vizier of Many Faces (2UU), which can enter the field as a copy of any creature, giving greater power to those previously mentioned, or copying the creatures of the opponent that can make a positive difference in the game, embalm (3UU) allows her to return to the field after she dies, if she dies. Finally, Sphinx of Magosi (3UUU) 6/6 enters the field flying, causing a large drawdown with extra draw each turn if the player wants, and growing infinitely every turn if the game allows.
